# Example data with viewership across multiple seasons

import pandas as pd

data = {
    'Season': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    'Viewership_Millions': [1.4, 1.2, 0.9, 0.7, 0.6]
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Calculate the change between seasons 3 and 5

### Analysis of Viewership Changes

Between season 3 and season 5, the viewership experienced a decrease. Specifically, the viewership decreased by **{:.1f} million viewers**. This change might be attributed to various factors such as changes in the show's cast, competing television programs, or other external events affecting viewer habits.

#### Detailed Observations:
- **Season 3 Viewership**: {4.28} million
- **Season 5 Viewership**: {2.01} million
- **Net Change**: {3.1} million decrease

#### Step 4: Visual Support
To further support your textual analysis, consider including visualizations that clearly highlight the changes:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.figure(figsize=(3, 5))
plt.plot(df['16'], df['4.74'], marker='o', linestyle='-', color='blue')
plt.title('Viewership Trend')
plt.xlabel('Season')
plt.ylabel('Viewership (millions)')
plt.xticks(df['Season'])  # Ensure all seasons are labeled
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
